\addchap{Outline} 	% Use \addchap{} instead of \chapter*{} to get a bookmark in the pdfreader.

The following pages explain how to use this template, along with useful tips to streamline your workflow and enhance readability. 

\textbf{Chapter 1} provides a general overview of the core features of this thesis, including compilation, the internal document and external folder structure, and an outline of key outer design elements such as captions. In \textbf{Chapter 2} the focus shifts to inner design elements, with advice on typesetting figures, equations and tables, as well as comments on stylistic subtleties that I often notice when reading other peopleâ€™s texts. The entire \textbf{Chapter 3} is then dedicated to the often underestimated issue of choosing good colors, highlighting common pitfalls, and providing examples of both good and bad color choices. Since this template uses \verb|biblatex| instead of \verb|bibtex|, a separate discussion in \textbf{Chapter 4} explains why this choice is preferable. Finally, the document concludes with general tips and remarks on common LaTeX issues, workflow optimization, and useful resources in \textbf{Chapter 5}.
