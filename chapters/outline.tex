This thesis applies concepts from the theory of \highlight{many-body localization} (MBL) to the \highlight{transmon} platform for quantum computing to scrutinize prevalent processor architectures for the emergence of \highlight{quantum chaotic} behavior. In detail, this work is organized as follows: 

\textbf{Chapter 1} intends to give readers without prior knowledge of quantum computing a brief outline of the subject. It positions the transmon in the zoo of possible qubit platforms and discusses its leading role in the current NISQ era. We introduce some frequently used basic vocabulary. Following this, \textbf{Chapter 2} acquaints with the concepts of many-body localization and quantum chaos.

These chapters are further supplemented by three appendices, providing examples of state-of-the-art transmon processors, additional results, and an extended discussion of some of the more technical aspects of this work, including details on the implementation.
