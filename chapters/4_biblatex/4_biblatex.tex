\chapter{Bibliography with BibLaTeX}\label{cha:biblatex}

\section{How to cite papers.}
Blablabla, have a look at this cool paper \cite{berke_transmon_2022}. Note the `P' because it is one of \highlight{my} papers. Here is a regular paper \cite{aruteQuantumSupremacyUsing2019a} with a million authors, such that BibLaTeX uses (depending on your settings) \textit{et al.} and here is another paper \cite{magesan_effective_2020} with only two authors. Finally, here is one of my papers that is not yet published, and, therefore, I decided that it deserves its own category \cite{inpreparation}.
