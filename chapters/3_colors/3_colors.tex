This chapter explores key aspects of color selection, outlining fundamental requirements for an effective color scheme. Since line plots and surface plots are by far the most common types of visualizations, the chapter provides a detailed discussion of each. It examines common pitfalls and offers examples of both good and poor color choices for various use cases.

\section{Introduction: What is a good color scheme?}
Selecting well-suited colors is a surprisingly complex challenge, yet a well-designed colormap is crucial for effectively conveying information. An effective color scheme should ideally
\begin{itemize}[itemsep = 1pt]
	\item maximize perceptual resolution,
    \item be distinguishable for color-blind readers, see Secs.~\ref{sub:lineplots_and_color_deficiency} and \ref{sec:rainbow},
    \item work in monochrome print,
    \item be aesthetically pleasing,
    \item perform well on both screens and paper (addressing the `RGB vs. CMYK' issue---colors that appear vibrant on screens, where they are created by mixing red (R), green (G), and blue (B) light, often look duller when converted to the CMYK color space used in printing),
    \item respect semantic resonances~\cite{linSelectingSemanticallyResonantColors2013} (e.g., `blue = cold' and `red = hot')\footnote{Note that such associations can vary depending on cultural conditioning. The association of `blue' with `cold' is nearly universal, but, e.g., the colour of mourning is white in Japan, but black in many western cultures.}. In my thesis, for example, red indicates regions of quantum chaos and blue localized regimes, as chaos poses a threat to quantum computing, and red is instinctively associated with danger,
    \item be perceptually uniform for surface plots, see \secref{sec:perceptualuniform},
    \item maintain a consistent order for all viewers, see \secref{sec:rainbow}.
\end{itemize}

For specific use cases, additional points may apply (see, e.g., Ref.~\cite{moreland2009}). The importance of color-blind accessibility should not be underestimated, given that approximately 6\% of all males have deutan color vision deficiency (green blindness).
Creating a colormap that meets all these criteria is difficult---if not impossible. A good colormap is ultimately a compromise.

\subsection{Useful resources}
Most modern plotting tools come with well-designed default color cycles for line plots and colormaps for surface plots (e.g., the widely used \verb|viridis| colormap). If you're already satisfied with the default appearance of your plot, you may not need to change anything. However, if you're not entirely happy with the look, there are plenty of excellent resources available online.

In my thesis, I frequently used Paul Tol’s color schemes \cite{paultol}, which are designed for color-blind accessibility, as well as the ColorBrewer colormaps \cite{colorbrewer}. Both resources are integrated into various plotting libraries. For example, the entire ColorBrewer palette is available in ColorSchemes.jl, Makie.jl and pgfplots, and a selection of Paul Tol's color schemes is also available via ColorSchemes.jl.
Lastly, while I didn’t end up using any of its colormaps, I found \href{https://www.vis4.net/palettes/}{vis4.net} \cite{chromajs} to be a handy tool. It allows users to create custom color palettes and provides a simulation of how the chosen colors appear to individuals with different types of color blindness.

\subsection{The most important use cases}
In my thesis, I had four main use cases for colors, some with specific sub-cases:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep = 1pt]
	\item Line plots:
		\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
			\item qualitative,
			\item pairwise,
			\item sequential. 
		\end{itemize}
	\item Surface plots:
		\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
			\item qualitative,
			\item divergent,
			\item sequential. 
		\end{itemize}
	\item Colored text or text on colored background, e.g. filled cells in tables, see e.g. \tabref{tab:table3}.
	\item Other design elements, drawings, or accent colors (e.g., in captions).
\end{itemize}
The last category is straightforward: When color perception does not affect the conveyed information---such as sketches of physical systems (e.g., a pendulum) or accent colors for headings---I based my choices purely on personal preference. The other cases are discussed in detail in the following sections.

\section{Colors for text and background}
{\color{dqblue} When highlighting text or table cells, it's essential to ensure high contrast between background and text:} 
{\color{dqcyan} Use dark colors for text on a white background (or as a background for white text) and bright backgrounds for dark text.}
{\color{dqgreen} In my thesis, I rarely employed colored text or backgrounds, but when I did, I was satisfied with the bright colors from the pale palette and the dark colors from the dark palette from Ref.~\cite{paultol}.} 
{\color{dqyellow}(Incidentally, the dark palettes are used to color this paragraph.)}
{\color{dqred} See \tabref{tab:table3} for an example of how the pale color palette can be used to fill table cells.}
\colorbox{dqblue}{\color{white}Finally, this} \colorbox{dqcyan}{\color{white}is an example} \colorbox{dqgreen}{\color{white}of a bright text} \colorbox{dqyellow}{\color{white}snippet on a} \colorbox{dqred}{\color{white}dark background.}

\section{Line plots}\label{sec:line_plots}

The most common use cases for line plots are shown in \figref{fig:lineplotflavour}. 
Panel~(a) employs a qualitative (or categorical) color palette which should be used when plotting different quantities that require clearly distinct colors. Many excellent qualitative color palettes exist, including the default palettes of most plotting tools, e.g., Makie's default `Wong colors' \cite{wong2011}.

Panel~(b) also uses a qualitative colormap, but with colors grouped into pairs of a common base tone. A pairwise palette can be used to display a parameter-dependent quantity for two different parameter values. It visually reinforces that the same quantity is plotted, but under different conditions.
Alternatively, instead of color pairs, one can use a single color with different markers/line styles, also enhancing readability for colorblind readers or in monochrome print. 

Panel~(c) demonstrates a sequential colormap, which is useful when plotting a quantity that evolves as a function of an additional parameter (e.g., the magnetization as a function of the magnetic field, but for many different temperatures). This approach helps to convey how the quantity changes, such as the sharpening of a transition as temperature/system size decreases/increases.
Unlike qualitative color schemes, there appears to be no research on how to design good sequential colormaps for \emph{line} plots while ensuring sufficient contrast. My approach of sampling colors from maps designed for \emph{surface} plots is not always satisfactory. Such colormaps often include bright hues that may lack sufficient contrast against a white background. For instance, I used the iridescent sequential color scheme from Ref.~\cite{paultol} (see, e.g., Fig.~4.19 in my thesis), but one end of the colormap is very bright. However, one probably doesn't need to be overly rigid in these cases. The main goal of this type of visualization is not to enable precise numerical readings of data points but to illustrate a broader trend---such as the steepening of a transition---with clarity, and a non-perfect color scheme can do that, see again Fig.~4.19 in my thesis. You should only take care to use a colormap whose colors are instinctively put in the same order by all people, see the discussion in \secref{sec:rainbow}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Lineplots and color vision deficiency}\label{sub:lineplots_and_color_deficiency}

\figref{fig:lineplotcolorblindness} compares three qualitative color palettes for line plots: 
The high-contrast palette from Ref.~\cite{paultol} (top row), the first four colors of the standard Matplotlib palette (middle) and the default \LaTeX{} versions of the same color tones (bottom). The first column shows the original colors. The second column simulates deuteranomaly (partial loss of middle-wavelength photopigments, commonly known as green blindness), with a 70\% pigment loss. The last column presents the plots after grayscale conversion, serving as an approximation for monochrome printouts.

What are the key observations?
First, the high-contrast palette performs exceptionally well for colorblind readers.
All colors retain their basic hue and remain clearly distinguishable. Additionally, they exhibit distinct lightness levels, ensuring visibility after grayscale conversion (increase your screen brightness if you cannot differentiate between the grayscale versions of blue and black).
Second, the Matplotlib palette is moderately effective. It remains usable for individuals with deuteranomaly, though red and green appear muddier and more brownish, reducing distinguishability. This issue worsens as the percentage of pigment loss increases. Grayscale conversion significantly reduces contrast, with all colors except orange appearing similar in brightness.
Third, the \LaTeX{} colors perform poorly. Red and green both shift towards a yellowish/orangish tone in the second column, making them harder to distinguish for readers with color vision deficiency. After grayscale conversion, green and orange become difficult to differentiate in the monochrome version. I do not find these colors visually appealing either. 

These examples illustrate the importance of carefully selecting colors to ensure accessibility for all readers. Disclaimer: The 
colors after grayscale conversion may not be perfectly identical to an actual monochrome printout, see \href{https://1800officesolutions.com/monochrome-vs-grayscale-printing/}{this link}. However, based on available discussions on the topic, the printed result should closely resemble the grayscale version.

\section{Colormaps for surface plots I: Basics}

The second important type are surface plots, showing a color-coded quantity as a function of two variables. While it is possible to use three-dimensional plots with an additional axis for the respective quantity, I prefer the two-dimensional, color-coded version. In non-interactive axis environments, I often feel that a three-dimensional representation hides some of the information or makes it more difficult to grasp.

One distinguishes between sequential colormaps, divergent colormaps, and qualitative colormaps (along with some additional rare cases). Examples of each can be seen in \figref{fig:surfaceplotflavours}. The choice of colormap depends on the dataset and the message you want to convey.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\tikzsetnextfilename{fig_surfaceplots_flavours}
	\input{\here/tikz_surfaceplotflavours.tex}
	\caption{\textbf{Surface plots.} (a) A heatmap of the function $f(x) = \cos x + \cos y$, color-coded with the sequential \texttt{viridis} colormap. (b) The same $f(x)$, encoded with ColorBrewer’s diverging \texttt{RdBu} colormap. Note how (b) visually enforces the division of the data in regions of high, low and intermediate values. (c) A qualitative colormap (ColorBrewer's \texttt{Set1}) for categorical data, e.g., in a phase diagram.}
	\label{fig:surfaceplotflavours}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Sequential colormaps}
Sequential colormaps are ideal for data that progresses in a continuous, ordered manner without any particularly pivotal values. They transition from a highly saturated color to progressively desaturated shades, often increasing in luminance until they terminate at or close to white. The gradual shift in saturation and luminance maps naturally to scalar values, making sequential colormaps often the default choice in visualization software. A well-known example is the \texttt{viridis} colormap used in \figref{fig:surfaceplotflavours}(a), which is colorblind-friendly and perceptually uniform---an important property that is discussed further in \secref{sec:perceptualuniform}.

\paragraph{Diverging colormaps}
Diverging colormaps contain two dominant color components and transition from one to the other through an unsaturated midpoint (typically white or yellow), see \figref{fig:surfaceplotflavours}(b). This visually separates the data into three regions: low, midrange, and high values. Diverging maps are particularly useful for bimodal datasets, where values deviate from a central reference point. A classic example is a topographic elevation map, where sea level is represented in white, elevations below sea level in blue, and elevations above in tan.
In my thesis, I use diverging colormaps for scalar values that signal a transition between two distinct regimes, in my case `chaos' and `localization'. I found ColorBrewer’s \texttt{RdBu} to be particularly effective, as it quickly and intuitively highlights the key point: chaos dominates one parameter region, localization another, and a `twilight zone' exists in between. See, e.g., Fig.~4.13 in my thesis.

One common drawback of diverging colormaps is the lack of a natural color ordering. To compensate for this, carefully selecting colors with intuitive associations, such as using `cool' colors for lower values and `warm' colors for higher values, can enhance readability.

\paragraph{Qualitative colormaps}
Qualitative colormaps consist of a collection of highly distinguishable yet unordered colors. They are best suited for categorical data, where distinct values need to be visually separated but do not follow a natural sequence. A good application is phase diagrams, where different areas of, e.g., a two-parameter landscape are assigned unique colors based on the phase a system resides in. See \figref{fig:surfaceplotflavours}(c) for an example.

\paragraph{Cyclic Colormaps}
A use case I never encountered in my work is cyclic colormaps. These are designed for data where values wrap around at the endpoints, such as phase angles or times of day. Start and end colors are the same to convey periodicity in the data.


\section{Colormaps for surface plots II: Nerdy knowledge}
\subsection{Perceptual uniformity}\label{sec:perceptualuniform}
\href{https://xkcd.com/1882/}{Colors are a complicated issue.} There is a plethora of different, usually threedimensional color models: RGB, BGR, HSV, HSL, Lab and many more. Each color is specified by three parameters, e.g. the amount of red, green and blue (RGB), or hue, saturation and lightness (HSL).   

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{format = sidebyside, indention = 0cm} 
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth}
	\vspace{-5pt}
	\caption{\textbf{Colormaps in different color spaces.} Shown are three different color ranges, obtained by choosing equally-spaced points on a straight line between the initial (green) and final (blue) color in different parameters spaces. For example, the RGB map consist of equally spaced points between (0,1,0) and (0,0,1) in the $(r,g,b)$ parameter space.}
	\label{fig:colorspaces}
\end{minipage}\hfill 
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.55\textwidth}
	\centering 
	\vspace{0pt}
	\tikzsetnextfilename{fig_colorspaces}
	\input{\here/tikz_colorspaces.tex}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure} 

Let's say that we picked two colors as the end colors of a yet to be defined colormap. We can think of this colormap as a line in a threedimensional colorspace connecting the end colors. We want a discrete number of colors, say ten. It is certainly reasonable to choose the colors such that their `distance' is the same for any two pairs of neighboring colors, e.g., the colors 1 and 2 should `differ as much' as 2 and 3, and so on. At this point, we have no precise idea of what a color distance actually is. A first guess is to take the Eucledian distance $||\vect{p}_1-\vect{p}_2||$, where $\vect{p}_i$ is the vector of the three parameters of the color $i$.  Let's do this for three colorspaces, RGB, HSV, and Lab, which is easily accomplished with Julia's \verb|Colors.jl| package:

\begin{lstlisting}
c1, c2 = RGB(0.0, 1.0, 0.0), RGB(0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
cmapRGB = range(c1, stop = c2, length = 10) 
cmapHSV = range(HSV(c1), stop = HSV(c2), length = 10) 
cmapLab = range(Lab(c1), stop = Lab(c2), length = 10) 
\end{lstlisting}

This creates arrays of colors whose parameters (in the respective color space) change uniformly from \verb|c1| to \verb|c2|. For example, the `blue' values in \verb|cmapRGB| are uniformely spaced, $0,\frac{1}{9},\frac{2}{9},\ldots,1$, and the `hue' parameter in \verb|cmapHSV| takes the values $120,133\frac{1}{3},146\frac{2}{3},\ldots,240$.
The resulting colors are shown in \figref{fig:colorspaces}. 
The end colors are the same, but the intermediate colors vary depending on the color space used for interpolation. A striking observation is that, despite all neighboring colors having equal distance in some color space, we perceive the three colormaps very differently. For example, the greenish HSV colors are barely distinguishable, while the bluish tones appear distinct. This results in a poor colormap with `flat' areas, where differences between scalar values are not accurately resolved. To a lesser extent, the RGB colors exhibit a similar issue near the blue end, whereas the Lab colors remain well-distinguished throughout.

The key takeaway here is that a reasonable colors distance metric is not necessarily determined by an Eucledian color space distance, but by how the human eye and brain interpret those differences. A well-designed colormap is \emph{perceptually uniform}: Equal steps in the data should correspond to equally perceived changes in color---just as a fixed distance on the $x$ axis of a plot always represents the same step in scale. For example, in a topographic elevation map, a shift from 1500 meters to 1200 meters below sea level (represented by a change from dark to lighter blue) should be perceived as the same elevation increase as a shift from 1000 meters to 1300 meters above sea level (which might be represented by a transition from tan to a lighter tan).
The human vision is a very complex issue and one that requires extensive empirical studies, see e.g. Refs.~\cite{rogowitz1996,mullen1985,crameri2020}. For example, research has shown that the human brain perceives changes in lightness far more effectively than changes in hue when interpreting data~\cite{rogowitz1996}. As a result, colormaps with a monotonically increasing lightness are generally more intuitive and easier to interpret for viewers.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\tikzsetnextfilename{fig_colordiffs}
	\input{\here/tikz_colordiffs.tex}
	\caption{\textbf{Lightness and color distances.} The three panels show the lightness $L$, as well as tow different color metrics for uniformely spaced in colors in (a) RGB, (b) HSV, and (c) Lab color space. For details, see the main text.}
	\label{fig:colordiffs}
\end{figure}

In \figref{fig:colordiffs}, we analyze the lightness (blue line) of the colors in the colormaps from \figref{fig:colorspaces} to see if our intuition (Lab is the best, followed by RGB, and then HSV) holds true.
The three panels confirm our anticipation:
\begin{itemize}
\item The RGB colors (left) exhibit a relatively constant change in lightness in the greenish range, but plateau near the blue end, making the last colors harder to distinguish.
\item The HSV colors (middle) maintain an almost constant lightness near the initial color, which matches our earlier judgment that the greenish hues are barely distinguishable.
\item The Lab colors (right) display a uniform decrease in lightness, ensuring well-distinguished colors throughout the entire range.
\end{itemize}

It is no coincidence that Lab performs best, as the Lab color space is designed to maintain consistent perceptual differences when picking regularly spaced $(L,a,b)$ points. The $L$ component directly represents lightness. There are more color spaces that take human color vision into consideration, the earliest being CIEXYZ, defined in 1931. It was developed using experimental data from human test subjects. However, CIEXYZ is not perceptually uniform, leading to the introduction of CIELAB (Lab) and CIELUV (Luv) in 1976, which address this limitation.

The CIE (Commission internationale de l'éclairage, french for International Commission on Illumination) also introduced various color distance metrics, typically denoted as $\Delta E^*$, where $E$ stands for the German word `Empfindung'. The first definition, called $\Delta E^*_{ab}$, was simply the Eucledian distance in the Lab color space. As the understanding of human color perception evolved, non-uniformities in the CIELAB space, particularly in highly saturated regions, where discovered. To improve accuracy, better distance metrics were developed. The most advanced is CIEDE2000, $\Delta E^*_{00}$, which aligns with the latest research on human color vision. 
\figref{fig:colordiffs} also depicts $\Delta E^*_{ab}$ and $\Delta E^*_{00}$. 
Per definition, $\Delta E^*_{ab}$ remains constant for the Lab colors, while it peaks in the other two cases and decreases toward the edges. For $\Delta E^*_{00}$, the absolute magnitude is particularly significant: as noted earlier, colors in the green (HSV) and blue (RGB) regions are hard to distinguish. This is reflected in the $\Delta E^*_{00}$ values, which approach zero in those areas, whereas in the Lab space, a certain minimum distance is consistently maintained.



\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\tikzsetnextfilename{fig_machbands}
	\input{\here/tikz_machbands.tex}
	\caption{\textbf{Mach bands in diverging colormaps.} Shown is the function $f(x) = \cos x + \cos y$, color-coded with a colormap with (a) a sharp change in lightness at the white point, resulting in white Mach bands and (c) a smoothened lightness evolution. Panel (b) shows the lightness values $L$ for the two colormaps.}
	\label{fig:machbands}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Mach bands in diverging colormaps}

Diverging colormaps typically pass through an unsaturated midpoint, often white. As a result, creating a perceptually uniform colormap by interpolating colors in the Lab color space (as done previously) is not possible. One possible approach is piecewise interpolation, i.e., moving from one color to white and then taking a sharp turn.  Such a sudden transition from increasing to decreasing lightness can activate the human eye's edge-detection mechanisms and create artificial visual features called Mach bands. It is often beneficial to soften the lightness gradient near the midpoint to avoid abrupt visual edges. This comes at the cost of a slight perceptual flat spot around the vanishing lightness gradient. For technical details on how to smoothen the lightness transition, see, e.g., Refs.~\cite{moreland2009,kovesi2015}.

\figref{fig:machbands} compares two diverging colormaps (taken from Ref.~\cite{moreland2009}) applied to the function $f(x) = \cos x + \cos y$. The colormaps share identical edge colors, but (a) has a sharp peak in lightness, while (c) has a smoother transition. The respective lightness values are shown in panel (b). In (a), the peak creates white Mach bands, whereas in (c), these artificial features are absent, thanks to the flattened lightness near the midpoint.
While (c) may be preferable in many situations, it is not always the better choice. In some cases, a sharp transition can be desirable, especially when the white midpoint carries specific significance. For example, in \figref{fig:machbands}, the contour lines where $f(x)=0$ could represent the Fermi lines of a square lattice tight-binding model. If the goal is to highlight the precise shape of the Fermi line, a sharp contrast is advantageous.

In summary, when selecting a diverging colormap, be mindful of potential artifacts and carefully consider whether these are undesirable or beneficial.

\section{An example: Rainbow vs. good colormaps}\label{sec:rainbow}

To conclude this chapter, let's examine an example that highlights the advantages of a scientifically derived colormap and the serious drawbacks of a poorly chosen one. We consider a two-dimensional plot of the function $f(x)= \left(1 - \sqrt{y} \right)  \cos x^3$, which represents an oscillation with increasing frequency in $x$ direction that is damped along the $y$ axis, where we restrict $y$ to $\left[0,1\right]$. This is a rough approximation of the spatial contrast sensitivity (SCS) function often used to benchmark colormaps, see, e.g., Ref.~\cite{moreland2009}. While I am unsure if a standardized definition of the SCS function exists, I believe my choice effectively conveys the intended message (and I will continue to use the abbreviation SCS for $f(x)$.
\figref{fig:sensitivityfunction} presents a two-dimensional plot of the SCS function using the perceptually uniform \verb|viridis| colormap.
Notably, the oscillations remain well-resolved in the strongly damped upper region where $y \lesssim 1$.

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{format = sidebyside, indention = 0cm} 
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth}
	\vspace{-5pt}
	\caption{\textbf{Spatial contrast sensitivity (SCS) function},  $f(x)= \left(1 - \sqrt{y} \right)  \cos x^3$. The oscillations along the $x$ axis and the damping along the $y$ axis are clearly visible throughout the selected region of the two-dimensional $xy$ plane. In this section, we will use the resolution of these features in $f(x,y)$ to evaluate the performance of different colormaps.}

	\input{\here/tikz_sensitivityfunction.tex}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure} 

Next, we will examine the same plot using three different colormaps, along with their colorblind and monochromatic versions. Specifically, we will consider:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \verb|cividis| colormap, introduced in Ref.~\cite{nunez2018}. This colormap is derived from the \verb|viridis| scheme and modified to optimize readability for colorblind viewers (albeit at the cost of being less aesthetically pleasing, according to its creators \cite{nunez2018}).
\item the \verb|batlow| colormap, one of several perceptually uniform colormaps designed by Fabio Crameri and introduced in Ref.~\cite{crameri2020}.
\item the \verb|gist_rainbow| colormap  which serves as an example of a poor colormap that obscures data, introduces artificial features, and ultimately confuses users.\footnote{Given their well-documented and long-known shortcomings, it is surprising how widespread rainbow-like colormaps are. 
Not long ago, they were the default choice in many popular plotting libraries, such as the \texttt{jet} colormap in Matplotlib before 2017. Throughout the 2000s, they dominated scientific visualization \cite{borland2007}. However, in recent years, awareness of their drawbacks has grown, leading to the development of better alternatives, \texttt{viridis} being the most widely adopted.}
\end{itemize}

We can already draw insights from the colorbars associated with these maps, shown in \figref{fig:colorbars}. The figure also includes versions accounting for the most common types of color blindness, as well as grayscale conversion. Unlike in \figref{fig:lineplotcolorblindness}, where partial photopigment loss was assumed, this time we consider total loss of one of the three types of human photopigments (e.g., deuteranopia rather than deuteranomaly, etc.).

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\tikzsetnextfilename{fig_colorbars}
	\input{\here/tikz_colorbars.tex}
	\caption{\textbf{Colorbars} for the three colormaps whose performance in conveying data effectively we will examine further with the SCS function shown in \figref{fig:sensitivityfunction}. The columns 2--4 show how these colorbars are perceived by individuals with a reduced sensitivity to red (protanopia), green (deuteranopia, the most common form of color blindness), and blue (tritanopia, very rare) light.}
	\label{fig:colorbars}
\end{figure}

The main observations include: (i) The \verb|cividis| and \verb|batlow| colormaps exhibit a clear and uniform progression toward higher brightness, which is consistently maintained across all color blindness variants. (ii) \verb|cividis| avoids green or red hues, meaning its appearance changes minimally for individuals with protanopia or deuteranopia. (iii) \verb|gist_rainbow| has sharp lightness peaks in yellow and cyan, and extended intermediate regimes where the colors appear almost unchanged, particularly in the green range. The effect of these `flat' areas worsens for colorblind users. For example, in protanopia, the colormap effectively reduces to just three broad color bands (gray, yellow, and blue) with 
short transitions between them. (iv) \verb|gist_rainbow| lacks a clear order, which is particularly apparent after grayscale conversion, where multiple recurring light and dark regions make a mapping between shade and numerical value impossible. This ambiguity leaves ample room for misinterpretation, even for non-colorblind readers.

We now apply the colormaps to the SCS function to evaluate their effectiveness in communicating information.
The results are shown in \figref{fig:sensitivityCVD}. I was surprised by how much worse the rainbow colormap resolves the features of the SCS function compared to the scientifically derived colormaps. Let's break down the differences and issues, starting with the original colormaps shown in the first row.

\paragraph{The original colormaps}
Both \verb|cividis| and \verb|batlow| are able to resolve the oscillations across the entire $y$ range. In contrast, \verb|gist_rainbow| exhibits several problems. As noted earlier, the map features areas of high local contrast where the lightness peaks, creating false anomalies---thin, bright, dome-shaped lines in cyan and yellow. Additionally, the flat regions of nearly constant lightness result in low perceptual contrast. This makes it difficult to distinguish variations, particularly in the greenish area where $f(x) \approx 0$. Finally, the rainbow colormap lacks a clear order: the starting color (red) and the ending color (pink) are very close in brightness, making it challenging to intuitively map colors to numerical values without referring to the colorbar.

Each colormap is also displayed in its colorblind and grayscale versions. \texttt{cividis} and \texttt{batlow}, with their monotonically increasing lightness, effectively convey the function's features across all visual impairments and in monochrome print. In contrast, \texttt{gist\_rainbow} exhibits problematic color transitions, with areas of high contrast leading to perceived anomalies, especially in colorblind versions, and poor resolution in regions with low contrast. In addition, the lack of a clear order between colors hampers interpretation.}

\paragraph{The CVD colormaps} 
Individuals with color vision deficiency can still resolve all relevant features when using one of the two scientific colormaps,  \verb|cividis| and \verb|batlow|. As discussed earlier, due to the absence of green and red tones, the \verb|cividis| plots appear nearly identical to readers without color blindness or with red or green blindness. The colorblind versions of \verb|gist_rainbow| are problematic. For example, in the case of protanopia, large regions of gray, blue, yellow (and white if the screen brightness is at maximum) dominate the image, while details within these areas are very hard to distinguish. Similar issues occur for the other types of color blindness. For individuals with deuteranopia, the colormap even suggests a non-monotonic behavior of $f$ in $y$ direction. Bright yellow lines appear, but on either side, the color becomes muddier, creating the illusion of similar numerical values on both sides.
This poses a serious problem, as more than 5\% of all males have deuteranomaly or deuteranopia (meaning the percentage is likely even higher among physicists (hopefully, this will change in the future)).

\paragraph{Monochrome colormaps} Due to their monotonically increasing lightness, \verb|cividis| and \verb|batlow| continue to convey information effectively in monochrome prints. The non-monotonic lightness of the rainbow colormap has its most detrimental effect here. It is impossible to map a numerical value to a particular gray shade, even when the colorbar is provided. Additionally, oscillations near the upper edge of the plot are not properly resolved.

What we've discussed qualitatively can be supported quantitatively by explicitly calculating lightness variations or assessing the performance of the colormaps using CIE distance metrics, see \secref{sec:perceptualuniform}. Such an analysis, along with additional technical information, is provided in \appref{app:A}.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we explored various areas where colors are used, such as in text, backgrounds, scientific plots, and for highlighting, while providing useful advice on what to consider when choosing colors. We have explored different types of plots, including line and surface plots. The key takeaways are: (i) ensuring readability for colorblind readers is essential, and (ii) for surface plots, perceptual uniformity is crucial. Scientifically derived colormaps should be used to ensure that a specific change in data corresponds to an equally perceived difference in color. Fortunately, in recent years, these concerns have been recognized by creators of common visualization software, making it easy to design plots that are both aesthetically pleasing and effectively communicate information to all readers.

Finally, if this discussion has sparked your interest in colors and color spaces, then Refs.~\cite{kovesi2015,moreland2015,moreland2009,crameri2020} are a good starting point to learn more.
