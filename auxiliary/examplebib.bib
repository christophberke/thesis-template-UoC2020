  abstract = {We introduce an algorithm for automatic selection of semantically-resonant colors to represent data (e.g., using blue for data about “oceans”, or pink for “love”). Given a set of categorical values and a target color palette, our algorithm matches each data value with a unique color. Values are mapped to colors by collecting representative images, analyzing image color distributions to determine value-color affinity scores, and choosing an optimal assignment. Our affinity score balances the probability of a color with how well it discriminates among data values. A controlled study shows that expert-chosen semantically-resonant colors improve speed on chart reading tasks compared to a standard palette, and that our algorithm selects colors that lead to similar gains. A second study verifies that our algorithm effectively selects colors across a variety of data categories.},

  abstract = {From the perspective of many-body physics, the transmon qubit architectures currently developed for quantum computing are systems of coupled nonlinear quantum resonators. A certain amount of intentional frequency detuning (`disorder') is crucially required to protect individual qubit states against the destabilizing effects of nonlinear resonator coupling. Here we investigate the stability of this variant of a many-body localized phase for system parameters relevant to current quantum processors developed by the IBM, Delft, and Google consortia, considering the cases of natural or engineered disorder. Applying three independent diagnostics of localization theory \textemdash{} a Kullback\textendash Leibler analysis of spectral statistics, statistics of many-body wave functions (inverse participation ratios), and a Walsh transform of the many-body spectrum \textemdash{} we find that some of these computing platforms are dangerously close to a phase of uncontrollable chaotic fluctuations.},

  abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2–7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

Analytic expressions are obtained in the qubit case and the higher-level model is solved both perturbatively and numerically, with the solutions agreeing well in the weak-drive limit. The methods are applied to parameters from recent experiments and, accounting for classical cross-talk effects, results in good agreement between theory and experimental results.}
