Since I forgot to mention them in the acknowledgments of my thesis, it's probably about time to thank all the incredible contributors on TeX.StackExchange who tirelessly help others solve their problems. I have particularly benefited from the insights and solutions provided by egreg, David Carlisle, Ulrike Fischer, Gonzalo Medina, Heiko Oberdiek, Martin Scharrer, Stefan Kottwitz, Lockstep, Jake, Peter Grill, Alan Munn, samcarter\_is\_at\_topanswers.xyz, Moewe, Percusse, Christian Feuers√§nger, Stefan Pinnow, and many others. Your expertise and generosity are truly appreciated!
